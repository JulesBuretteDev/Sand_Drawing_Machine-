The goal of this project was to build a sand drawing machine from scratch. 

In this project, I used a raspberry pi, an artuino (GRBL library) with Stepper motor shield.
I used Sandify to build my library of patern in the sand. 

You will be able to find the code used for the arduino which is plugged to the motors and also have a screen attached on to build the IMH. 
raspiFiles is the the files that I used on my raspberry pi. 
Also, you will be able to find my 3D models on the 3DFiles directory.
